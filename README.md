# AccJoon
AccJoon is a little tool to exert MSAA library to present a command line interface to interact with any software. If you know the `acc path` of a controller then AccJoon can find the controller for you and run an action on it. Currently, supported actions are listed below. Hope to extend AccJoon capabilities in the near future

### Actions
- Click
- Double Click
- Middle Click
